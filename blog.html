            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, You are probably wondering how this code was made. This was all built within a week. After some research
                and previous knowledge from my stats class in University.<br><br>

                I was familiar with golden crosses moving averages, Time series, Z regression and RSI. I thought, how about I use my recent
                knowledge of machine learning to predict stock prices. Machine learning consists of deep neural networks that can learn from previous data and provide new input.

                I knew this was going to be a big project and I was already feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work. So, I decided to break it down into small parts and have my prompt engineering skills help me.

                May 26 - Research <br>
                So I figured with my losses in stock investment and what I was taught in university was not very helpful with real life investments. Time series was not very acurate as it was only useful for Moving average stock predicitons, based on the previous amount of days. This model won't be able to identify
